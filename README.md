# Getting started
- Install dependencies
```****
cd <project_name>
npm install
```

- Start server
```
npm start
```
For auto-reload (nodemon), use:
```
npm run watch-node
```

Or you can compile and serve js files
```
npm run compile
node ./dist/server.js
```

This will start the server on port **3000**.
